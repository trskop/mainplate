-- | Parse 'String' as a 'FilePath' pointing to a file. What this function does
-- is the following:
--
-- * Checks that the file path is not empty (@\"\"@).
--
-- * Checks for cases when the file path is obviously not a directory, in other
--   words, it checks that it doesn't have a trailing path separator character
--   at the end.
--
-- * Normalises the file path.
--
-- Anything beyond that would require IO, which is intentionally not used to
-- allow use cases in pure code.
